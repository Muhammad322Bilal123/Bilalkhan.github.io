        Here, we just subclass the Dropout layer and override the call() method to force its
training argument to True (see Chapter 12). Similarly, you could define an MCAlpha
Dropout class by subclassing AlphaDropout instead. If you are creating a model from
scratch, it’s just a matter of using MCDropout rather than Dropout. But if you have a
model that was already trained using Dropout, you need to create a new model that’s
identical to the existing model except that it replaces the Dropout layers with MCDrop
out, then copy the existing model’s weights to your new model.
In short, MC Dropout is a fantastic technique that boosts dropout models and pro‐
vides better uncertainty estimates. And of course, since it is just regular dropout dur‐
ing training, it also acts like a regularizer. Here, we just subclass the Dropout layer and override the call() method to force its
